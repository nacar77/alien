    <a><b>My dearest alien, as i look into your eyes, i see a future filled with endless possibilities a future where our love knows no bounds. From the moment i met you, i knew that you were the one i had been searching for the one my soul had been yearning for. so let's go back to my main point and my intention for you, so alien even though many things will come when we try these two, i can only say that we will be strong in the most difficult times, us. can always look back and go back to the past how we started, just always look back and see alien, because we can show it and tell ourselves that it will be strong even if something comes into our relationship that shouldn't and we itself will not let it lean on one another-one will be a handkerchief to everyone so that even if this situation comes we will not be moved by what they are doing. You'll always remember alien, i'll always be here for you, i'll always wait when you're there, you'll come when you're there, i'll always be here, i won't give up, i'll be strong too, and if you'll be strong, we' ll both be strong, i'll always be here for you, no it's just me but your family and friends who support you in whatever you do, that's an achievement. for you and i will be happy for that, i will always cheer you on and support you in whatever happens that you will face and i will also face in life because i am just starting but i am doing this because of you. i don't want to lose you and i will do everything every day and i will prove to you that i can do this not only in words because i will also prove in action i can show you that my intentions towards you are pure and that i entered into a relationship with you. Once again Happy monthsary my alien I am lucky for you and I am thankful and blessed to have you in my life thank you for everything to me iloveyou so much my alien🥰✨👽🌻🦋</a>
